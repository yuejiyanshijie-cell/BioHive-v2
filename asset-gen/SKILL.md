# Asset Generator

Generate PNG images (Gemini or xAI Grok) and GLB 3D models (Tripo3D) from text prompts. These are paid APIs — every call costs real money. Tools live at `${ASSET_GEN_SKILL_DIR}/tools/`; run from the project root and keep runtime-loaded outputs under `${RUNTIME_ASSET_DIR}/`.

## Models

| Model | Flag | Cost | Best for |
|-------|------|------|----------|
| Gemini | `--model gemini` | 5¢ (512) · 7¢ (1K) · 10¢ (2K) · 15¢ (4K) | Precise prompt following — references, characters, 3D refs, exact layouts |
| Grok | `--model grok` (default) | 2¢ | High quality but imprecise — textures, simple objects, item kits, scenic backgrounds |

Grok produces great-looking output but often ignores specific instructions; reach for Gemini when the result must match what you described.

## Images

```bash
python3 ${ASSET_GEN_SKILL_DIR}/tools/asset_gen.py image \
  --prompt "the full prompt" -o ${RUNTIME_ASSET_DIR}/img/car.png
```

`--model` (default `grok`) · `--size` (default `1K`; Gemini also `512`/`4K`) · `--aspect-ratio` (default `1:1`; also `16:9`, `9:16`, `4:3`, `3:4`, `3:2`, `2:3`).

**Image-to-image:** pass `--image ref.png` and the model sees the reference — prompt only for what changes (angle, pose, recolor), don't re-describe appearance. Use this for style families (one hero asset → the rest), variants, and multi-view sets.

**Small sprites:** minimum generation is 1K, so a 1024px image downscaled to 64px looks muddy. Design display sizes ≥128px, or generate a kit (multiple objects in one 1K image) and slice it with `tools/grid_slice.py ... --grid 2x2 --names "a,b,c,d"`, or prompt for bold flat forms that survive downscaling.

Review every PNG before any GLB conversion — a bad image wastes 30¢+ downstream.

### Background removal

Read `${ASSET_GEN_SKILL_DIR}/rembg.md`. Key rule: **never prompt for a "transparent background"** (the generator bakes a checkerboard) — prompt a solid color, then matte it out.

## Animated sprites

Recipe: **reference → pose → video → extract frames → loop-trim → rembg.**

1. Reference (Gemini 1K, neutral pose, solid BG) — anchors everything; review carefully.
2. Pose per action: image-to-image from the reference, prompt only the action.
3. Video from the pose frame: `asset_gen.py video --image pose.png --duration 2 -o walk.mp4` (`--duration` 1–15s, `--resolution` 720p; cost 5¢/s).
4. Extract: `ffmpeg -i walk.mp4 -vsync 0 frames/%04d.png`.
5. Loop-trim looping cycles (walk/idle): `tools/find_loop_frame.py frames/` returns the loop frame; delete frames past it. Skip for one-shots (attack/death).
6. Batch matte: `tools/rembg_matting.py --batch frames/ -o clean/`.

Reuse one reference for all of a character's actions. **Chaining** (feed action A's last frame as action B's start) keeps positional continuity — keep chains ≤2 deep, they drift.

## 3D models

```bash
python3 ${ASSET_GEN_SKILL_DIR}/tools/asset_gen.py glb  --image ref.png -o model.glb     # 30¢ default / 60¢ --quality hd
python3 ${ASSET_GEN_SKILL_DIR}/tools/asset_gen.py rig  --image ref.png -o rigged.glb    # +25¢, biped only
python3 ${ASSET_GEN_SKILL_DIR}/tools/asset_gen.py retarget --rigged rigged.glb \
  --animation preset:biped:walk -o walk.glb                                             # 10¢ per clip
```

Source image for `glb`: 3/4 elevated angle, solid white/gray background, matte finish, opaque glass, single centered subject — and **do not** rembg it (Tripo3D needs the solid bg). `rig` is biped-only and aborts if the mesh isn't humanoid; quadrupeds use plain `glb`. `retarget` reuses the rigged task id — run it once per animation against the same rigged GLB (no re-rigging). Don't assume the preset name survives into the GLB; inspect the imported clip names before wiring playback.

Biped retarget presets (pass as `preset:biped:<name>`):

```

```

### Tripo3D operations (important — avoids double-charging)

- Jobs routinely sit at 99% with empty output for minutes. Let the default timeout run.
- A timeout in `glb`/`rig`/`retarget` does **not** mean server failure. The task id is already saved in the `<output>.tripo.json` sidecar. **Do not resubmit — that double-charges.** Resume for free instead:
  ```bash
  python3 ${ASSET_GEN_SKILL_DIR}/tools/asset_gen.py resume -o model.glb
  ```
  Safe to re-run; it no-ops once complete. Delete the sidecar to force a cold start.

## Costs

Each generation costs real money, so confirm with the user before generating. Quick reference: texture/simple sprite (Grok) 2¢ · character/ref (Gemini 1K) 7¢ · background 2¢ (Grok) or 10¢ (Gemini 2K) · full 3D asset 37¢ (7¢ image + 30¢ GLB) · rigged character walk/idle/attack ≈ 92¢.

## Output and logging

Each command prints JSON to stdout: `{"ok": true, "path": "...", "cost_cents": 7}`. Progress goes to stderr — redirect it to a temp file and read only on failure to keep context clean:

```bash
_log=$(mktemp)
result=$(python3 ${ASSET_GEN_SKILL_DIR}/tools/asset_gen.py image --prompt "..." -o p.png 2>"$_log") || tail -20 "$_log"
```

Generate independent images in parallel (multiple Bash calls in one message).

## Visual pitfalls

Generators and vision checks have weak spatial sense — verify from screenshots when it matters.

- **Direction/orientation** is unreliable ("facing left" vs "right" often comes out identical). Generate one direction and flip horizontally at runtime rather than paying for the mirror.
- **Mixed sizes:** image frames are ~1024px, video frames ~720px. Downscale everything to the smallest source before matting (`magick in.png -resize 720x720 out.png`).
- **Playback fps:** source videos are ~24fps — drive sprite playback off elapsed time at ~1/24s, and only restart a loop when the animation state actually changes.

## Asset manifest (in README.md)

Track every generated asset in `README.md` with an **in-game Size** column — without it, coders consistently scale assets wrong:

- 3D models: meters, e.g. `4m long`, `1.8m tall`, `0.3m`
- Textures: tile size, e.g. `2m tile`
- Backgrounds: pixel size + behavior, e.g. `1920x1080, fullscreen`
- Sprites: display pixels, e.g. `128x128 px`

| Name | Description | Size | Path | Cost |
|------|-------------|------|------|------|
| car | sedan with spoiler | 4m long | ${RUNTIME_ASSET_DIR}/glb/car.glb | 37¢ |
